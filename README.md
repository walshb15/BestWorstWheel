# BestWorstWheel

![Demonstration Image](demonstrationImage.png)

A wheel inspired by RedLetterMedia's Wheel of the Worst. Intended to provide a way to virtually choose something from a given list.

The user can add or delete items from the wheel, as well as spin it. Items that are added are stored in a local SQLite database, so they are loaded again when the user closes and reopens the program.
